              <h3>Commerial Salesforce <=> Google synchronisation application</h3>
              <p>
                I was a core developer on a native Force.com application to synchronise Email, Calendar and
                Contact information between Google Apps and Salesforce.com platforms. The app made use of
                advanced Force.com techniques such as scheduled and batch Apex, webservices, triggers and visualforce.
                I built a second stand-alone Force.com application acting as a licensing server to perform product verification
                and registration, offering trial and paid functionality for the business' Force.com products. The app
                included an intuitive visual interface to allow administration.

              <h3>Salesforce-AWS Email Backup and Archiving System</h3>
              <p>
                I designed and implemented a robust archiving and retrieval system for Salesforce Email Messages, using
                Python and running on Amazon EC2. Business-critical Salesforce data was stored and synced on Amazon Web Services S3, drastically reducing storage costs.
                The system was successfully deployed for two separate customers. A high level of automated testing ensured the
                reliability of the system.

                I designed and implemented a system to perform backups of critical Heroku application databases, using Ruby
                and running on Amazon EC2. Database backups were rotated to ensure data integrity and keep storage
                costs under control.
