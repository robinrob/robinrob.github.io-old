I say &#39;programmers&#39;, because this will surely apply to at least both software developers and DevOps engineers, as two disciplines for which people use programming languages and into which I think people often fall as a result programming as a hobby.</p><p>Whilst trying to get something done in your own time, it can be tempting to think &#39;<strong>what if I automated this?</strong>&#39;. It may feel like a procrastination tool, and maybe it leads you down a rabbit hole of stolen time with no useful result. Or you automate a task and only ever do it once, finding that perfect, one-use-only regex - there&#39;s that old adage about programmers.</p><p>I definitely have this tendency, and of course I make use of it in work environments too, but in a work situation I have to be brutally pragmatic about what is worth automating. For instance, using a build tool to automate your web app build and initiate a watching/reloading task is one of the most common and time-saving tasks for a web developer.</p><p>At home however I can engage any flight of fancy I like and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone in doing so, but I think it is mostly a healthy thing. For one thing, being better at spotting tasks that <em>can</em> be automated seems like a useful skill for a developer or anybody who uses programming languages in their job to automate things. For another, it can be a useful excuse to learn a new programming language or tool.</p><p>That last reason is why I decided to learn ZSH inside-out several years ago. I&#39;d only ever had a basic, empirical-type of knowledge of shell programming languages, so I had only ever written pretty basic scripts in them. So on late nights after work, I started writing ZSH functions to automate tasks I was doing in the terminal over and over again, and this became quite addictive and fun. It also put me to sleep pretty effectively.</p><p>As well as automating things I did often, I set myself coding challenges to do things that <em>weren&#39;t</em> useful, just to see if I could, and to see how one might do it in ZSH. It&#39;s not that ZSH or shell languages in general are particularly fun or attractive languages to code in, but novelty is a stimulating thing and as a programmer you may as well have a better knowledge of shell languages.</p><p>Sometimes a task really <em>was</em> too hard or annoying to code in ZSH so a few tools written in Python or Ruby have been added. In this way I also challenged myself to learn Ruby - and, what is now one of the most valuable tools in my toolbox - regex. Yet another excuse to <a href="https://rsmith.io/blog/learn-regex-or-regret-it/">learn regex!</a></p><p>Overall, as with the personal side-project, I think this kind of habit of developers is a great thing, and really helps to maintain that love for programming, that can sometimes become a little jaded after too much hard work.</p><hr><span class=post-meta>Posted by Robin Smith on January 29, 2018</span></article><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a data-placement=top data-toggle=tooltip href="/blog/when-to-write-unit-tests/" title="When should you write unit tests?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li></ul><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>
