      and

      \.
    %p
      If you aren't familiar with FireBug or Web Inspector,
      %span.weinre weinre
      isn't going to make too much sense to you.
      %span.weinre weinre
      reuses the user interface code from the
      %a{:href => "http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebInspector"}> Web Inspector project at WebKit
      ,
      so if you've used Safari's Web Inspector or Chrome's Developer Tools,
      %span.weinre weinre
      will be very familiar.  If you're not
      familiar with Web Inspector, the links above to Google's and Apple's documentation
      will be useful.
    %p
      Here's an example session using
      = succeed ":" do
        %span.weinre weinre
    %p
      %img{:src => "images/weinre-demo.jpg"}/
    %p
      Two screen captures are shown above.  On the left is the
      %span.weinre weinre
      %b client
      application, displaying debug
      information.
      On the right is the
      %b target
      web page, running in Mobile Safari in the iOS Simulator.
    %p
      In normal usage, you will be running the
      %b client
      application in a browser
      on your desktop/laptop, and running a
      %b target
      web page on your mobile device.
    %p
      In the session above, the debugger is display the Elements panel, with the
      embedded console expanded in the bottom third of the window.  In the console
      area, we've entered two statements:
    %pre
      :preserve
        
        document.body.style.backgroundColor
        document.body.style.backgroundColor = "pink"
    %p
      The result of running the first statement shows the value of the body's background style is not set.
      The second statement sets the body's background to pink.  That horrifying pink
      background is then rendered in the
      = succeed "'s" do
        %b target
    %p
      In addition, an
      %tt h1
      element is selected in the upper third of the
      Elements panel, which causes the side panels on the right to be filled in with
      relevant information.  In this case, the matched CSS rules for that
      %tt h1
      element are being shown.
    %p
      If you are familiar with WebKit's Web Inspector,
      a partial list of differences between it and
      %span.weinre weinre
      are listed below:
    %ul.spaced
      %li
        %span.weinre weinre
        does not make use of any 'native' code
        in the browser, it's all plain old boring JavaScript.
      %li
        Because
        %span.weinre weinre
        doesn't use 'native' code,
        it's functionality is limited.  For instance, source level debug of JavaScript
        is not
        %span.strike possible
        = succeed "." do
          %a{:href => "http://lexandera.com/aardwolf/"} easy
      %li
        Because
        %span.weinre weinre
        doesn't use 'native' code,
        the debug target code will run on browsers
        without specialized debug support.  For instance, a browser running on your phone.
      %li
        %span.weinre weinre
        supports 'remote' interaction,
        so you can run the debugger user interface on one
        machine and can debug a web page running
        on another machine.  For instance, debug a web page displayed on your phone from your
        laptop.
      %li
        Because
        %span.weinre weinre
        supports 'remote' interaction,
        multiple debug clients can be debugging the same debug target at the same time.
      %li
        One thing
        %b not
        different from Web Inspector is that the debug client
        user interface only runs on WebKit-based browsers.
    / ========================================================
    %h2 Supported Libraries and Platforms
    %p
      Generally version numbers listed here are the earliest
      versions of the relevant thing that have been tested.
      Later versions of those things are also hopefully supported,
      but let us know.
    %h3 Libraries not supported
    %ul
      %li
        versions of Prototype.js before version 1.7 are not supported,
        as they do not support the
        %tt JSON.stringify()
        API correctly.  You
        will get an
        %tt alert()
        in the web page you are debugging if you
        attempt to debug it with
        %span.weinre weinre
        and you are using an unsupported
        version of Prototype.js.
    %h3 Platforms supported - debug server
    %p
      Any platform that supports
      = succeed "." do
        %a{:href => "http://nodejs.org/"} node.js
    %h3 Platforms supported - debug client
    %p
      The browser where the debugger user interface runs.
    %ul
      %li
        Google Chrome
      %li
        Apple Safari
      %li
        Other recent-ish WebKit-based browsers
    %h3 Platforms supported - debug target
    %p
      The browser with the page you are debugging.
    %ul
      %li
        Android Browser application
      %li
        iOS Mobile Safari application
      %li
        PhoneGap/Cordova
      %li
        other
    %h3 Platforms not supported - debug target
    %ul
      %li
        iOS 3.1.3 or earlier
      %li
        webOS 1.45 or earlier
