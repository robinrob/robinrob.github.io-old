              I can build responsive websites that look great on all popular screen sizes. I can handle both backend and

            <p>
              I have a detailed knowledge of the Force.com platform in designing and building diverse
              applications from business automation logic, to custom backup and archive solutions, to

            <p>
              I can create custom integrations utilising web services to connect cloud platforms such as Google, Salesforce
              and AWS. I am also experienced in automating business processes using Apex on Force.com or Google

            <h3>Commercial Salesforce &laquo;=&raquo; Google synchronisation application</h3>
            <p>
              I was a core developer on a native Force.com application to synchronise Email, Calendar and
              Contact information between Google Apps and Salesforce.com platforms. The app made use of
              advanced Force.com techniques such as scheduled and batch Apex, webservices, triggers and visualforce.
              I built a second stand-alone Force.com application acting as a licensing server to perform product verification
              and registration, offering trial and paid functionality for the business&quote; Force.com products. The app
              included an intuitive visual interface to allow administration.

            <h3>Salesforce-AWS Email Backup and Archiving System</h3>
            <p>
              I designed and implemented a robust archiving and retrieval system for Salesforce Email Messages, using
              Python and running on Amazon EC2. Business-critical Salesforce data was stored and synced on Amazon Web Services S3, drastically reducing storage costs.
              The system was successfully deployed for two separate customers. A high level of automated testing ensured the
              reliability of the system.

            <h3>Heroku Database Management Tool</h3>

              I designed and implemented a system to perform backups of critical Heroku application databases, using Ruby
              and running on Amazon EC2. Database backups were rotated to ensure data integrity and keep storage
              costs under control.
