          mathematical background and skill-set which means I am happy working on complex applications. I have worked on large
          exerprise applications with financial business logic. I also have experience building web and mobile games using

              Front-end Web Development
            </h3>
            <p>
              I can build responsive websites that look great on different screen sizes, with an extensive knowledge of
              HTML and CSS. Using Javascript and frameworks such as AngularJS and jQuery I can build complex front-end
              applications that respond quickly. I have a great attention to detail and I can build functional user
              interfaces that look great and are easy and intuitive to use for the end-user.

              Server Development
            </h3>
            <p>
              I am at home using Python, Node, Ruby, or Java and can write server APIs and logic to do things ranging
              from CRUD operations, to performing financial calculations or complex data manipulation.

              Consultation on code architecture and improvements
            </h3>
            <p>
              Code design is a crucial aspect of software development and I have experience with designing my own applications
              and tools from scratch. I have consulted on and performed refactorings of existing code in order
              to help projects scale, with good results.

              Test suites and Continuous Integration
            </h3>
            <p>
              I am a big fan of using automated back-end and front-end test suites as a basis for ensuring correct functioning of web applications,
              particularly those that make use of complex logic. I have lots of experience with unit testing in Python, Ruby
              and Java, and front-end test suites using Karma and Protractor with AngularJS. I can write test suites
              or setup continuous integration for your projects.

            <h3>Commercial Salesforce/Google synchronisation application</h3>
            <p>
              I was a core developer on a Force.com application to synchronise Email, Calendar and
              Contact information between Google Apps and Salesforce.com platforms. The app made use of
              advanced techniques such as scheduled and batch Apex, and used triggers and web services.
              I architected and built a second stand-alone Force.com application acting as a licensing server, to perform product verification
              and registration, offering trial and paid functionality for the business' Force.com products.
            </p>

          <li class='cf project-salesforce-s3'>
            <h3>Salesforce-AWS Email Backup and Archiving System</h3>
            <p>
              I designed and implemented an archiving and retrieval system for Salesforce Email Messages, using
              Python and running on Amazon EC2. Business-critical Salesforce data was stored and synced onto Amazon Web Services S3,
              reducing data storage costs.
              The system was successfully deployed for two separate customers. Automated testing helped ensure a high
              reliability of the system.

            <h3>Heroku Database Management Tool</h3>
            <p>
              I wrote a tool to perform backups of Heroku application databases, using Ruby
              and running on Amazon EC2, with customisable backup rotation functionality.
