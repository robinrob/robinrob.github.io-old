            I offer the following services:

          %li
            %h3
              Front-end Web Development
            %p
              I have a great working knowledge of front-end development, using HTML, CSS and Javascript/jQuery/AngularJS to create responsive web
              designs that look great and work well on different screen sizes. I am experienced with designing from scratch interfaces to take the user through complex workflows.
              I also have experience of automated front-end unit testing, using Selenium, Karma and Protractor.
          %li
            %h3
              Server Development
            %p
              I have a wide experience of server-side languages and technologies including: Python, Ruby, Java, Flask, Pyramid, Django, Ruby on Rails, MySQL, PostgresSQL, Latex.
              I can design and implement APIs and business logic for a diverse range of business domains, to perform complex functions including
              financial computation and report generation.
          %li
            %h3
              Test suites and Continuous Integration
            %p
              I strongly believe in the importance and the economy of good automated testing to ensure robustness of an application,
              especially the parts with complex logic. I am very experienced with implementing automated back-end and front-end test suites
              and with integrating these into a continuous integration tool, such as Bamboo and CircleCI.
          %li
            %h3
              Code Design
            %p
              Code design is a crucial aspect of software development and one which I care strongly about. In a previous project,
              I have designed a scalable server-side architecture which was taken up with enthusiasm by the rest of the team.
              Over time, it allowed the application to easily scale as the project grew. When starting a major new piece of functionality
              or project from scratch, I always take the time to find a pragmatic solution before coding starts.

          %strong Some previous projects I have worked on.
        %ul
          %li.cf.project-network-rail
            %h3 Network Rail Business Information Tool
            %p
              I spent two years helping to develop an internal business web application for Network Rail, built using AngularJS, Flask
              and MySQL.
              The application was for internal use to allow cost/benefit analysis, reporting and data management.
              I built a front-end report-building wizard combined with a server-side report generation engine capable of taking
              the user input and producing large PDF reports. The report generation engine was designed in a modular way to make adding
              new modules very easy. I also worked on financial algorithms and built numerous intuitive interfaces and wizards to
              allow manipulation of data by the user.
          %li.cf.project-alumina
            %h3 Commercial Salesforce/Google synchronisation application
            %p
              I was a core developer on a Force.com application to synchronise Email, Calendar and
              Contact information between Google Apps and Salesforce platforms. The application made use of
              techniques such as scheduled and batch Apex, triggers and web services.
              I architected and built a second stand-alone Force.com application acting as a licensing server, to perform product verification
              and registration, offering trial and paid functionality for the business' Force.com products.
          %li.cf.project-salesforce-s3
            %h3 Salesforce-AWS Email Backup and Archiving System
            %p
              I designed and built an external email archiving and retrieval system for manaing Salesforce emails, using
              Python and running on Amazon EC2. Business-critical Salesforce data was stored and synced onto Amazon Web Services S3,
              reducing data storage costs.
              The system was successfully deployed for two separate customers. Automated testing helped ensure a high
              reliability of the system.
