        <div class='cv-experience-content'>
          I relocated to Vancouver as a lead engineer to help start up a new Network Operations Centre for Cloudreach in North
          America. I helped build team of AWS-certified DevOps Engineers capable of handling critical failures in
          &#x2013; and restoring service to &#x2013; customer web application stacks. I continued my previous work and
          trained new team members in DevOps and software development
          best practices. A highly-functioning team was established and was recognised by the business for performing
          to a high standard as well as upholding its core values.

          I provided DevOps and software development services for a range of customer and internal
          production web applications and stacks. I wrote business-critical code on the Force.com platform for
          internal processes, email management and improvement of internal business analysis.
          I gave customer consultation and implemented software solutions within customer Salesforce environments.
          I designed and developed an internal email archiving system using python, to archive support case
          emails from Salesforce into Amazon S3. The archiving tool was also deployed in customer production environments.
          I wrote custom data export and backup tools for the Heroku and Salesforce platforms.
          I was recognised by Cloudreach Ltd for being Easy To Work With.

          I was the first developer in the new Edinburgh office, working on web applications using the Django and
          Play frameworks, and the Salesforce Force.com platform. Projects used test suites with continuous integration
          running on a Bamboo server.
          I became a core developer on the company's first sellable product: Alumina Connect &#x2013; a substantial
          application which ran in Force.com and synchronised user data between
          Salesforce and Google Apps. I designed and
          developed a separate licensing application which ran on the Force.com platform and was used
          to license installations of Alumina Connect in customer environments. I wrote and
          maintained a custom continuous integration tool using shell scripts and Ant to automate deployment of
          code from source repositories to Force.com. The tool was used by the team throughout development
          of Alumina Connect, and later by other parts of the business on separate customer projects.
