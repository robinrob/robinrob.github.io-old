          :markdown
            Designed and implemented a secure data integration and synchronisation solution to allow a customer to sell their products through a third-party
            vendor. Wrote itinerary pricing logic in two backend pricing APIs using Python, Pyramid and PostgreSQL,
            deployed in Heroku.

            Quickly got up to speed on a new business domain, contributing immediately. Identified code
            that needed better automated testing and significantly increased reliability of pricing logic.

          :markdown
            Worked with the DevOps team, using Chef and Splunk to automate creation of
            custom customer stacks and implement custom monitoring.

            Worked on front-line support to fix critical issues in customer stacks, engaging the customer with great
            communication, followed up with investigation and process improvements and reported back to the customer.

            Developed a reliable system to archive support case emails from Salesforce into Amazon S3, to save costs.

            Relocated to Vancouver with one other colleague to start up a new Network Operations Centre for Cloudreach in North
            America, with the aim to grow a team built on best pratices. We interviewed and mentored 8 new DevOps engineers,
            leading to them becoming AWS-certified engineers. The team was recognised by Cloudreach for its high standards
            and upholding core values with a great culture.
