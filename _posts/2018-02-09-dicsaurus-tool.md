I may be slightly obssessed with doing everything from the command-line, but through various custom scripts and
functions I've turned my command line environment into a very general multi-purpose tool that allows me to do a lot
of things very quickly and with minimal UI. As totally logical information-processing
machines, developers need only receive reasonably-formatted textual input in order to get stuff done.

Out of a need to quickly look up synonyms for words, and a desire to make it as painless as possible, and also have the
output customisable, I've created a small tool named [Dicsaurus](https://github.com/robinrob/dicsaurus).

## Example usage:
Dictionary mode: `./dicsaurus.py -t blue`
Output: <img src="blah"/>

Thesaurus mode: `./dicsaurus.py -t blue`
Output: <img src="blah"/>
