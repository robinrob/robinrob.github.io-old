## Background
Shortly after I began my first full-time job as a web developer, I began hearing about freelancers through general conversation.
The comments associated with them were usually something about their high pay relative to their equivalent full-time employed
workers, or off-hand remarks about the (lower) quality of the work they produced. Sometimes a colleague would mention that
they had freelanced in the past, before returning to full-time work. At the same time, the app stores of the mobile
platforms were mature and I knew there were developers out there who could make a full-time living off these.

A few years later, a colleague and good friend admitted that he was even making a small monthly income from the Android Market, for a couple
of apps he had made in-between finishing his PhD and starting his first job. As one who tries to see things for their true merits
and some sense for romanticism, these ideas interested me. I filed them away in the back of my mind as something I'd perhaps
want to aim for some day. In the meantime I continued with my purpose of learning as much as I could about software development
and cloud technology.

A few years later, I found myself thinking about freelancing more and more, and eventually decided to set myself a firm target. I
chose a nice round number and decided I wanted to be freelancing by that particular age. In the end, a friend in the same field decided to make
the same jump before me, and told me all about his experiences throughout the process, and how much he was enjoying some of the
benefits. Another friend in London revealed he was also contracting in a different area of work. At that point I chose a date in the following year by which I wanted to be freelancing, and an amount of money I'd
need to have in the bank by then before making the jump (enough to live for 6 months without work).

I have now been freelancing for two and a half years; here are some of my experiences so far.

## The Switch
Once I had left my job, I began looking for work. It was an exciting period because time felt critical, and at the same
time I was enjoying the freedom of the break from work. Fortunately, the same freelancing friend was able to refer
somebody looking for a freelancer to me, since my friend was busy at the time, and I ended up with a job just a few weeks later.
The feeling of satisfaction at succeeding with the first job was great. And once you have reached that point it is really up to
you whether you want to continue with freelancing or not.

Over time, I found many great benefits to the freelancing lifestyle, including for me the ability to work home.
But depending on the person, there can be drawbacks too. It is easy to imagine the pros
and cons being completely different for different people. If the cons outweigh the pros, you can always go back, so
freelancing is the sort of thing I definitely recommend trying for someone who is considering it.

## Benefits of freelancing (or contracting)
There's a subtle distinction between 'freelancing' and 'contracting'. For me it means the freedom to take on contract jobs,
whilst also being responsible for your own learning and keeping up with the technology, and the potential for making
money from personal projects. So it's to do with independence. These are the benefits i've experienced so far:

* **Independence.** The feeling of independence is great, and extremely rewarding.
* **Pay**. You set your own rates, so your pay is more directly determined by your technical ability.

### Benefits to working from home
* **The ability to work in your own environment.** This is nice because if you are the sort of person
who naturally tends towards the most efficient ways of doing things, this can increase your efficiency a lot. Working from home
also leads to precisely setting your own schedule - when to start work, when to have lunch, for how long, and when to finish.
This kind of independence can massively increase happiness.
* **Avoiding commutes.** Doing no commuting at all literally returns hours of the day back to you,
to use however you want. It also means that whilst everybody else in the outside world is stressfully trying to get to work on time,
you have the leisure to take your time. If you like to enjoy hobbies in your spare time, this is a real plus.
* **No office politics.** This ranges from the minor things like who empties the dishwasher, or arguments over who ate whose food from the fridge,
to things like inter-employee annual reviews or inter-team competition for the next job up the 'ladder'. Nobody needs that stress!
* **Flexibility.** If you need to pop out to do some errand during the day, you can just find a convenient time
and go and do it. Parcels? You are always in, so these are never a problem either.
* **Added motivation to socialise.** Working from home can feel isolating at times, but you can turn it into a positive thing
by using that to motivate yourself to socialise more. When you're around people in an office all day, you may not want to go
and be around even more people in the evening. But when working from home, you really relish it. So start some sociable hobbies that
you may not otherwise have done.
* **Romanticism.** It's a romantic thing to be able to say that you work from home, and an increasing trend. It's like a hint
of a possible alternate future where society operates differently.

## Possible downsides to working from home
* **Responsibility.** With the increase in flexibility with your time, comes a great responsibility to manage it well. When
you can choose your working hours, you will naturally want to work when it most suits you. But it can also be tempting to
become lazy, even without realising it. If you find yourself getting up later than you'd like, and doing less hours, or working
during hours in which you're less productive, or working at the weekends, it's important to notice and self-correct these things. You can come out of it
with much clearer goals about what you actually want to achieve, and more there discipline towards achieving those goals. The
importance of cleanly dividing your work and leisure time I found to be fundamental. My personal choice is actually to work from 8am-4pm,
as these are the hours when I am most productive. It also keeps me in sync with the schedules of friends, with obvious benefits.
* **Loneliness.** This can take time to have its effect, but the effect of rarely interacting with people in person can be quite
profound, depending on the type of person that you are. It can lead to a massive loss in productivity in all areas of your life,
and you may not even notice it for a while either. You need to recognise it and find a solution, like changing to a job
where you are working on-site, or a combination of that and working from home.
* **You get sick of your home.** I can attest to this as a real phenomenon! And it can put you off doing hobbies that you would
usually do at home. In the end you need to find the correct personal balance between all things you do, to stay fully
motivated.
* **No company benefits.** Such as holidays. Not having paid holiday means that whenever you are going on holiday, the true 'cost' of the holiday
now includes the time you spent on holiday multiplied by your rate! Again, this is the sort of thing that forces you to really
solidify your life goals, and decide how much holiday you need. When deciding your day rate, you need to take into account all
of the monetary benefits you may be missing out on by going independent.
* **Unpredictable work load** This is one of those risk factors you must factor in when deciding your date rate, and you have to
judge the risk of each project or job individually. Fortunately in software development at the moment, the demand is fairly high,
so for a good developer making a consistent effort to build contacts and exposure, it is definitely possible to maintain a constant
work load.
* **You cannot easily go back to full-time work?.** I don't know whether this is a valid point or not, but I can't see why
this would reasonably be an issue. Putting myself in the position of an employer, i'd hire somebody who had been freelancing
as long as they explained their motivations for wanting to change, and those reasons made sense. You can also argue that they'd have
additional skills developed through being independent.

## Conclusion
So far, I am really enjoying the freedom to spend my time how I want. I can choose between work or personal projects, and since
monetising my own apps is another goal of mine, I consider this time well spent. My idea of my job is much more fuzzy than a
particular job role. My job is whatever I need to do to achieve my goals, and I wake up excited to get closer to them.

There have been challenges and I have overcome them, and i've definitely learned a lot of useful skills through taking
on more personal responsibility, and these will be useful in any future situation.

Long-term I am completely open-minded about what I end up doing regarding working freelance vs. full-time,
and I can totally understand the points for and against freelancing.
