The web and mobile software development industry appears to change very quickly, with new languages (and versions of
languages) and frameworks appearing all the time.

There are also countless formal named methodologies for how to go
about software development.

New features are appearing in languages all the time, through specific updates to existing
languages - for example: Lambdas and first-class functions in Java 8, generators in ECMAScript 6) - to more general
trends like the increasing inclusion of functional programming concepts in modern languages, particularly in new
languages like Swift where there is the opportunity to start completely afresh. (Of course it's not that
functional programming ideas are new! But there is some constant of ~30 years added to the uptake time of
all new technological ideas).

To a curious-minded developer, languages and even frameworks are fun to learn almost for their own sake, particularly new ones.
Each language for example has its own character and subtly leads you into doing things in particular, sometimes new, ways. Sometimes these
new methods solve problems that you've often come across whilst using other languages, so there is excitement at the
prospect of future benefit from these new features. There is an emotional response to the creative aspects of the
language, to things as simple as its appearance or empathy for particular decisions its designers have made.

When a language update or new language includes a computer science concept that you're not familiar with, it can serve
as a nice introduction and an extra mxotivator to go and learn about it, or to refresh your knowledge about it.

As you climb up the stack and new the things become higher and higher-level, or the multiplicities of new things becomes
great, it becomes more and more necessary to be pragmatic about what you spend your time on. The hierarchy of knowledge
and skills that you need in web software goes roughly (from low- to high-level):

* Mathematics
* Creativity
* Computer science
* Programming languages
* Software design
* Databases
* Web protocols (e.g. HTTP, SSH)
* Cloud technologies
* Web frameworks
* Libraries

All of the above areas of skills and knowledge are required in order to make complex web applications. As you go down
the list, the concepts become higher and higher-level, they become easier and easier to create from scratch and examples
of them become more and more numerous.

Things like computer science knowledge and software design are skills that a developer needs to apply to all
software development situations. Practical and thorough understanding of these comes through actually making applications,
in diverse scenarios. So to some extent is necessary to delve into multiple programming languages and application
frameworks.

At some point though you have to start to become pragmatic about what is worth spending time on learning. Once a developer
has learned several languages or frameworks, acquiring new ones becomes quite easy and inexpensive. I'd say that usually something like
a moderately complex personal project will give you 95% of the knowledge and fluency of a particular language or framework
that you need to be really effective with it professionally. Different projects are going to use different aspects
of languages or frameworks to lesser and greater amounts, so as long as you have knowledge of a bit of everything,
any codebase is going to be recognisable.

My personal emphasis has now shifted towards spending more time actually making things. Given an initial concept,
I am confident that I can create what I set out to, choosing the tool that feels best for the particular project at that particular time.
However it is still important to keep up with the trends by doing things like reading blogs or [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), or going
to technology meet-ups.

It can feel as though a lot of emphasis gets placed on the virtues of having experience with a given new web framework, as
it suddenly becomes popular. And of course over time, these new ways of doing things are healthy as a way of gradually
optimising ways of working, keeping up with the changing demands of web software as the infrastructure becomes more
powerful over time.

But I do think it's important to keep the focus on the fundamentals - the fundamental skills
of being able to choose the right tool or language to use, to write software that is structured nicely, and to make
useable applications. I think these are the real differentiators between developers, are the most valuable to aspire to and take the most time to learn
in the first place.

Therefore the natural conclusion is to spend good time at every level of the 'knowledge stack', on an on-going basis
(always stay humble and open to new ideas and knowledge), but to prioritise towards the fundamentals, and the
best way to do all of that is just to keep making applications, which is of course the point all along. Start with a creative
idea, work towards it and you will keep learning what you need to.
