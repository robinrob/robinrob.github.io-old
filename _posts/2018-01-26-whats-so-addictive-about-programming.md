When I say obsessive, I mean because I sometimes do things like modify old personal projects I haven't touched for years, if I
see something in them that feels unfinished or wrong that I'd forgotten to get around to improving.
Or I see the opportunity to indulge a little *'What if I did this'*
thought. I try to justify it to myself with the thought that maybe i'll need to use that particular language or
framework again soon, and the refresher will help.

Maybe I'm biased, but it seems to me that as a group programmers are on average relatively highly-motivated, and
passionate about what they do. I think this is down to two things:

1. Programming is a highly technical and specialised skill
2. Programming is highly creative

When a field is highly technical, it takes a lot of motivation to develop the knowledge and skills required to be
productive in it. Therefore similarly, you will find a high occurrence of motivated doctors and surgeons within their profession. You wouldn't expect to ever be seen
by an unmotivated doctor or surgeon! I'm talking about long-term, principled motivation of course.

Programming combines the technical with the artistic, in a similar way that architecture does the hardware world. The
difference with programming is that the programmers not only design but actually build the end product themselves. A
single programmer can complete the entire lifecycle of a product from idea to release - and this is extremely
compelling indeed. It arouses feelings of independence, and when you
can make something your 'baby', and yours alone, you experience a certain euphoric satisfaction when you've done a good
job.

All creative endeavours require that the artist has a fundamental passion
and enjoyment of them in order to make you want to spend time on them. I'd also add an unreleased need for expression.
In fact, as long as one starts off with a
strong creative desire to make things, a strong vision of an end product, then this can be the motivating force required to get you over the barrier and drive
you want to learn all of the technical details that will allow you to achieve your objective. Creative energy can spur you into feverishly working through the night,
un-hestitatingly delving into documentation to find the information you need right now.

Afterall, who but the most
academic of people would really learn the details of computer science if it were not for some at least vague
dream of applying that knowledge to their own future masterpieces? When you learn about the natural sciences, you
learn something fundamental and unchanging about the world, from which you can deduce further things about the world.
So that even if you don't 'use' that knowledge directly, for example in any job or hobby, it can
be extremely satisfying to know in its own right. Much of the knowledge needed as a programmer comes
just from the world of human invention; mostly it has no intrinsic value. You really have to want to use it for it to
have any value. And the value you produce comes mostly from your creative abilities.

I see the purpose of most of the learning I do, to be to expand my possibilities for expression. Some things I learn
for pure intellectual curiosity (as with the natural sciences), but mostly I enjoy learning about programming or music or writing, because all of these
are methods to allow me to express ideas and emotions.

When a programmer writes some piece of useful code that works well, that they designed and that others may later use, the
satisfaction experienced is that of having applied hard-won technical knowledge and creative skill, to produce something
that has their mark on it, that only they would have produced. They may even indulge in a little joke within a comment, an easter-egg
for a future developer reading the code. Another programmer would have done something differently.

The feedback a programmer gets from working code is *instant*. They can write it, see that it works, be proud of it,
polish it off and already be moving onto the next piece. Few technical or creative disciplines allow you to create things so instantly, and make changes
later on where the only cost is that of the time required.

The end-results of a programmer's efforts are also *timeless*. Code, being pure information,
need never be lost, not only in principle but it is easy to achieve this [in practice]({{ url }}/blog/personal-code-library).
The programmer can effortlessly back-reference anything that they have produced before, which really facilitates not only
immediate, free re-use of useful code, but also learning from mistakes and improving over time.

The above factors are why when I started to learn programming, then play around with it, I felt a strong need to keep
doing it. Perhaps it explains some of the reasons why so many people seem to cross over *into* programming from other
fields, myself included. At every [TechMeetup](techmeetup.co.uk) event I go to I speak to at least one person
who is a student of [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com). Perhaps it's also why the programming community is so welcoming to those people - because
we all share this private understanding.
